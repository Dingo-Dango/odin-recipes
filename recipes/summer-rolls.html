    <h3 class="subtitle">Vietnamese Summer Rolls</h3>
    <p>Traditional vietnamese summer spring rolls are a refreshing and tasty meal, which can be eaten as a starter, side dish or main, or as we do in my house, all 3 at once.</p>
    <p>A versatile dish, which can be modified easily to accommodate the fussiest of eaters. Don't like prawns, no problem, we can have pork, or any other meat you can think of, or no meat at all. pick whatever veg you want to go in inside, the possibilities are endless. All you need is the rice paper and cold noodles as a base and the rest is wherever your imagination takes you.</p>
    <p>Add your favorite dipping sauce to the side, at home we use nuoc cham, the traditional vietnamese dipping sauce, and we also use maggi liquid seasoning, which is our own replacement for soy sauce. I have even seen people use peanut based sauces. </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h3>
    <p>please see below for the list of ingredients I use when cooking my version of summer rolls, I have put a note saying "optional choice" on anything that is interchangeable. Summer rolls can be tailored completely so you don't just have to swap the ingredients you can omit or add as many items as you want, if you can roll it, you can have it. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pack Vietnamese Summer Roll Rice Paper</li>
            <li>1 pack of vietnamese vermicelli rice noodles </li>
            <li>4-6 Pork loins, with fat (optional choice)</li>
            <li>300g Cooked and peeledKing Prawns (optional choice)</li>
            <li>1/2 a cucumber (optional choice)</li>
            <li>Coriander (optional choice)</li>
            <li>Mint (optional choice)</li>
            <li>British Round Lettuce (optional choice)</li>
            <li>Your choice of dipping sauce</li>
        </ul>
    <p>For the dipping sauce I highly recommend <a href="nuoc-cham.html">Nuoc Cham</a>, which is a traditional vietnamese dipping sauce. I have included the recipe, if you would like it, <a href="../recipes/nuoc-cham.html">here</a>.  </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place pork in a large pot and boil for 25 mins. Set aside once cooked</li>
            <li>whilst pork is boiling, place vermicelli noodles in a large pot, cover with cold water and heat, the trick is to not overcook, once the water starts bubbling, immediately remove from hot water and place noodles in a colander and rinse thoroughly with cold water, removing any residue, then set this aside. </li>
            <li>Pork should still be cooking after you have rinsed the noodles, use this time to prepare the veg, in my case, I would thinly slice the cucumber, break the coriander into smaller branches, rip the lettuce, and place all onto one plate.</li>
            <li>Rinse Prawns and set aside on small plate, once pork cooked, I rinse with cold water then thinly slice, set aside on separate plate. I place a plate under the colander with the noodles in and set that on the table along with all the meats and veg.</li>
            <li>Next, boil a lot of water, place the water in a large bowl, place bowl in the middle of the table</li>
            <li>Thats all the cooking done, all thats left to do is to place rice paper in the hot water to soften, put the rice paper on your plate, add noodles, veg, and meat. Then roll and eat if you are not sure how to do this then click <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/4_U3kNhMZOQ?si=u4octZdR2LnoxNyR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>  for a video tutorial</li>
