    <h3 class="subtitle">Nuoc Cham aka vietnamese dipping sauce</h3>
    <p>Traditional Vietnamese Dipping sauce, not just used for dipping but can be used as a sauce to put over your favorite dish. the sweet, sour, spicy and umami profile make it perfect addition for pretty much any dish.</p>
    <p>A staple in Vietnamese diet, it would be odd to not see a bowl of nuoc cham at a dinner table in Vietnam.</p>
    <p>Every family has there on take on nuoc cham, some add more ingredients, some add more spice, more sour, depends on taste. When I make it i use a strict ratio, when my father makes it, he adds ingredients by taste and color</p>
    <p>As this is a recipe I will give you the ratio that I use but not the exact amount, I believe that is part of the fun on making your own take of nuoc cham.</p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h3>
    <p>I have provided an ingredient list for my version of nuoc cham. Others may add more garlic, more or less chilli, and even add carrots, I will just give you the base you need and what I use at home </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Water - 5 parts</li>
            <li>Fish Sauce - 1 part. I use Squid brand make sure its a nice golden orange color, if it is too dark the flavor will be slightly off</li>
            <li>Fresh lime juice - 1 part</li>
            <li>Sugar - 1 Part</li>
            <li>Garlic - to taste </li>
            <li>Chilli - to taste (I use red chilli's to give the sauce a vibrant color)</li>
        </ul>
    <p>The amount of chilli and garlic required depends on how much water you use, I roughly put in a tablespoon of each for every tablespoon of fish sauce I use.</p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Get Container or bowl big enough for all your ingredients, add the water, fish sauce, and lime.</li>
            <li>Add in sugar, stir until dissolved.</li>
            <li>Chop Garlic and Chilli into small pieces and then using mortar and pestle crush.</li>
            <li>Add chilli and Garlic to the rest of the mixture.</li>
            <li>Stir, and that's it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can use the dipping sauce right away. To store keep in air tight container and when using make sure you use a clean plastic spoon and the sauce will stay good for up to about 2 weeks.</p>
